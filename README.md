# LivePress WP Theme
LivePress is a WordPress theme, released under GNU/GPL license.
It's **still under development**, many features have yet to come.

-- public demo will be available soon --

### Why LivePress
This theme was originally developed as a container of articles and news related to events happening in Ventura-Lambrate District during Milan Design Week. It was then extended to serve as theme for a general WordPress event-oriented website.

### What is yet to come
Since this project is still in development, many features and options have yet to find their way into it... here's a quick list of main future updates:
* header/footer logo customization in WP backend
* header tagline and event details customization in Appearance > Customize (currently available with custom widget)
* missing WP templates (404.php, search.php, ...)
* footer image section featuring instagram feed
